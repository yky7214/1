Abstract
We test whether simple, interpretable state variables—trend and momentum—can produce
durable, out-of-sample alpha in one of the world’s most liquid assets, gold. Using a rolling
10-year train→6-month test walk-forward from 2015–2025 (2,793 trading days), we convert
a smoothed trend–momentum regime signal into volatility-targeted, friction-aware positions
via fractional, impact-adjusted Kelly sizing and ATR-based exits. Out-of-sample, the strategy
delivers a Sharpe ratio of 2.88, and maximum drawdown 0.52%, net of a 0.7 bps cost and a
square-root impact term ( γ= 0.02). A regression on spot-gold returns yields a 43% annualized
return , a CAGR of 43%, and a 37% alpha (Sharpe 2.88, IR 2.09), at a targeted volatility of 15%)
andβ= 0.03, confirming benchmark-neutral performance. A friction-adjusted growth curve
g(L) =µuL−1
2(σuL)2−nkL−γ (nL)3/2defines a positive-growth frontier up to ∼$1 billion
AUM—only 0.07% of daily CME gold volume—beyond which impact concavely limits returns.
Statistical tests (bootstrap CI [2.49, 3.27]; SPA p= 0.000) confirm significance and robustness
to latency, reversal, and cost stress. We conclude that forecast-to-fill engineering—linking
transparent signals to executable trades with explicit risk, cost, and impact control—can turn
modest predictability into allocator-grade, billion-dollar-scalable alpha.
1 Introduction
We start with a simple question. If we build a clear, easy-to-understand signal that looks at whether
gold prices are trending up or down, can we actually turn that signal into real profits once we
account for the messy details of trading—like how risky each day is, how much trading costs eat
into returns, when to enter and exit, and how the strategy would behave if we tested it as if it were
running live? This question matters because many trading ideas look great on paper but fall apart
when tested in real life. It is easy to design a back-test that seems to “predict” prices if we ignore
trading costs or assume perfect timing. In reality, markets are noisy, trades slip, and every action

carries a cost. The real challenge is not forecasting prices, but seeing whether a simple and honest
rule still holds up after all those frictions are added. If a clear rule like “follow the trend when
it is strong” continues to work once we include risk, costs, and execution limits, then the edge is
likely genuine rather than luck or overfitting. This matters because it turns theory into something
practical. Many models look brilliant in hindsight, but few survive live trading. Our question asks
whether careful, transparent engineering can turn small, consistent patterns in the data into real,
durable performance.
We are not trying to predict exact price movements—that is nearly impossible. Instead, we ask
whether markets offer small, repeatable rewards that appear under certain conditions and disappear
under others. For example, when gold is trending strongly, traders who hedge or rebalance may
temporarily push prices in one direction, creating a short-lived edge. If we manage risk carefully
and trade with discipline, we can capture some of that reward without needing perfect forecasts. In
short, Our goal is not to guess the future, but toearn a consistent premiumfrom how the market
behaves in different states—using engineering and validation strong enough to survive skeptical
scrutiny.
Gold provides an ideal proving ground for systematic research because its price dynamics are
almost entirely information-driven rather than dependent on cash flows or credit risk. Historically,
gold has moved inversely to the U.S. dollar and real yields, making it a natural hedge against
monetary debasement and inflation shocks. Its deep liquidity and long price history allow robust
statistical testing, while its role as a “flight-to-quality” asset in risk-off regimes adds an additional
behavioral dimension. These features make gold a clean laboratory for studying how information,
sentiment, and macro conditions translate into price movement—without the confounding effects of
earnings or balance-sheet fundamentals.
We make four contributions.
1.From forecast to actual trades.We build a full pipeline that connects a simple market
signal to real, executable trades. It starts with smoothing prices to see the overall direction,
measures how confident we are in that trend, adjusts position size based on market volatility,
and finally decides how much to risk using a version of Kelly sizing that accounts for trading
costs. We also include clear stop and exit rules so trades are never left open without control.
2.Testing the right way.We use a strict “walk-forward” setup that mimics live trading. The
model trains on ten years of past data, then is tested on the next six months—never looking
ahead. We repeat this process month by month and only report results from the test periods.
This prevents any “cheating” from future information and makes our results realistic.
3.Showing the alpha is real.We prove the gains are not random or tied to the gold market
itself. The strategy produces returns that are mostly independent of overall gold prices
(β≈0.03) and are statistically significant in multiple tests. It still works when we add delays,
reverse the signal, or remove pieces of the model—meaning the edge is stable and not just a
lucky backtest.
4.Understanding how big it can scale.We calculate how trading costs and market impact
reduce growth as position size increases. Using a friction-adjusted version of Kelly’s formula,
we map out where returns start to level off. This gives an honest estimate of how much capital
the strategy could handle before performance fades.
We foreshadow our answer.In short, the strategy works the way it should. Out-of-sample, it
delivers a strong Sharpe ratio of about 2.9 with very small drawdowns and steady profits on the days

it is active. It remains profitable even after adding realistic trading costs and small execution delays.
When we intentionally flip the signal or remove key parts like trend or momentum, performance
collapses—as it should if the edge is genuine. Statistical tests confirm the results are not due to luck,
and our estimates of capacity show that the strategy could realistically scale to hundreds of millions
of dollars before impact starts to matter. In other words, the system behaves exactly as a robust,
well-engineered trading model should: clear rules, stable performance, and no hidden curve-fitting.
2 Data, preprocessing, and scope
2.1 Coverage and alignment
We use daily settlement prices for gold from the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and
COMEX. These are the most reliable and liquid data sources available, meaning they reflect real
prices that major traders and funds actually transact on. Using this dataset avoids the noise and
inconsistencies that appear in smaller feeds or intraday ticks.
The data we use runs through September 16, 2025. Our out-of-sample backtest is extended to
October 31, 2025, to align with the New York Stock Exchange business-day calendar. On holidays or
missing days, we simply carry forward the last known price—never the return—so that the sequence
of daily moves remains realistic and continuous. Returns are computed as simple close-to-close
percentage changes:
rt=Pt
Pt−1−1.
This ensures the results reflect actual price evolution, not artifacts from missing data. Reliable data
is the foundation of any backtest. If the prices are off by even a few basis points, the small edge we
are trying to measure could vanish or flip sign. Using standardized LBMA/COMEX data eliminates
that risk and keeps the analysis grounded in market reality.
2.2 Effective sample used by the walk-forward
Our walk-forward process requires a long history to train on before we begin testing. Each model
looks back ten full years of daily data to learn its parameters, then it is tested on the next six
months. Because our first out-of-sample window starts in January 2015, the first training window
must begin around January 2005.
This means that although raw data go all the way back to 1980, only the 2005–2025 period is
actively used. The earlier data are not needed and would add little informational value because
market microstructure and liquidity conditions before 2005 were very different. The goal is not to
use as much data as possible, but to use data that actually resemble today’s market. Ten years is
long enough to cover multiple economic cycles but short enough that the model still represents the
current trading environment.
2.3 Frictions
Every trade has a cost, so we model that cost directly. There are two main parts:
1.Linear cost:we assume a round-trip cost of k= 0.7 basis points (0.007%) per complete
buy–sell cycle. This approximates the bid–ask spread and broker fees in highly liquid gold
futures.
3

## Page 4

2.Market impact:large trades move prices against the trader. We represent this with a
“square-root” impact function, where the cost increases with the square root of trade size. We
set the impact parameter toγ= 0.02, which is conservative for gold liquidity.
We test cost multipliers (0.5×, 1×, 1.5×, 2×) later to stress the model under heavier friction.
Many backtests ignore transaction costs, but even a small underestimation can turn a good strategy
into a losing one. By including both spread and impact, we ensure that any observed alpha could
actually survive live execution.
2.4 Risk targets and constraints
To keep returns stable, we target a fixed volatility of 15% per year. This means the strategy
automatically takes smaller positions when the market is volatile and larger ones when it is calm.
Leverage is capped atW max= 2.0, so the system can never double its exposure.
Position size is determined by a fractional Kelly multiplier of λKelly= 0.40, which means we
only risk 40% of the mathematically optimal Kelly fraction. When the Kelly estimate is near
zero—meaning the edge is barely above costs—we still take a small baseline position equal to 25% of
the usual size. This keeps the model from sitting idle in uncertain periods. Volatility targeting keeps
risk consistent across time, which makes results easier to interpret and prevents sudden blowups.
The capped leverage and fractional Kelly scaling keep the strategy realistic and psychologically
tradable for a real fund.
2.5 What we do not do inFASTmode
In the headline configuration, calledFAST, we intentionally avoid adding slow safety filters such as
long-term moving-average (DMA) filters, daily loss caps, or turnover throttles. Those belong in the
STRESSEDconfiguration, which is used later for operational testing.
The goal ofFASTmode is to isolate the raw performance of the core signal under fair but
minimal constraints. If it performs well here, we can be confident it will still hold up once operational
safety layers are added. It’s the cleanest way to test whether the signal itself has genuine predictive
power.
3 Signal construction and economic intuition
This section turns raw daily prices into an implementable trading intent. Every transformation is
defined precisely so the entire pipeline is reproducible from first principles.
3.1 Prices, returns, calendar, and information
LetPt>0 denote the gold settlement price on trading day t(LBMA/COMEX close). We compute
simple close-to-close returns
rt≡Pt
Pt−1−1.
All decisions at day tare measurable with respect to the historical sigma-field Ft≡σ({P τ}τ≤t); no
quantity uses information fromt+1 or later within the same test segment.

## Page 5

3.2 Smoothing the price and extracting a slope
We smooth log-prices to suppress high-frequency noise while preserving drift. Define yt≡logP t.
The exponentially weighted moving average (EMA) with smoothing parameterλ∈(0,1) is
˜yt=λ˜y t−1+ (1−λ)y t,˜y 0=y0.
The one-step smoothed slope (a proxy for trend intensity) is the first difference
∆˜yt≡˜yt−˜yt−1.
All statistics used to normalize this slope are computedon the training window only. Let µtrainand
σtrain>0 denote, respectively, the sample mean and standard deviation of ∆ ˜ytacross the preceding
10-year training window. The standardized slope is
zt≡∆˜yt−µ train
σtrain.
Standardization stabilizes units so that thresholds are comparable across windows with different
volatility levels.
3.3 Mapping slope to a bounded trend confidence
Rawz tis unbounded. We clip and affine-transform it into a probability-like score in [0,1],
¯zt≡min{max(z t,−3),3}, p trend(t)≡¯zt+ 3
6∈[0,1].
Values near 0.5 correspond to neutral slope; values near 1 (resp. 0) indicate strongly positive (resp.
negative) slopes. This monotone transform is fixed (frozen) before the out-of-sample (OOS) segment
begins.
3.4 Momentum confirmation and blended regime probability
To prevent slope noise from triggering trades, we add a direction check via a K-day momentum
indicator. WithK= 50,
mt≡⊮Pt
Pt−K>1
∈ {0,1}.
The blend combines continuous slope strength and discrete direction:
pbull(t)≡ω p trend(t) + (1−ω)m t, ω= 0.6,
andpbear(t)≡1−pbull(t). The weight ωis optimized on the training window and then held fixed
during the OOS slice. A value above 0.5 indicates bullish conditions; below 0.5 indicates bearish.
3.5 Activation, entries, and exits
A long iseligiblewhen the regime is sufficiently bullish and the local slope is positive:
activate long attifp bull(t)≥0.52 and ∆˜y t>0.
We use the Average True Range (ATR) for volatility-aware exits. Let Ht, Lt, Ctbe high, low, and
close. The True Range is
TRt≡max
Ht−Lt,|H t−Ct−1|,|L t−Ct−1|	
,
5

## Page 6

and then-day ATR is ATR n(t)≡1
nPn−1
j=0TRt−jwithn=14.
Given an entry at priceP ent, we manage the position with:
hard stop atP ent−2 ATR 14(t),trailing stop at (peak price)−1.5 ATR 14(t),
and a maximum age of 30 trading days. If pbear(t) rises above 0 .50, we de-risk by halving or closing
the position. These rules bound losses while allowing winners to run.
4 Sizing, risk targeting, costs, and capacity
This section converts regime intent into an executable portfolio weight that respects risk, costs,
and market impact. All quantities that depend on data are estimated strictly within each training
window and then frozen before the corresponding out-of-sample (OOS) slice, so every test decision
uses only information that would have been available in real time.
4.1 Volatility targeting
The goal of volatility targeting is to keep risk roughly constant through time so that performance is
not dominated by a few high-volatility episodes. Letr t≡Pt/Pt−1−1 be daily simple returns and
letFtdenote the information available at the close of day t. We forecast next-day variance via an
exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), the stationary solution to a local-level Kalman
filter and the RiskMetrics standard [18]:
bσ2
t+1=θbσ2
t+ (1−θ)r2
t,bσ2
0= Var train(r), θ∈(0,1).
Here θcontrols memory length (larger θputs more weight on older data). We target annualized
volatility σ⋆
ann= 15%, a common allocator risk budget for liquid macro sleeves [ 15]. Converting to
daily usingD= 252 trading days,
σ⋆≡σ⋆
ann√
D.
We then scale intended exposure inversely to the forecasted volatility and cap it at a leverage limit
Wmax:
w(vol)
t≡min
Wmax,σ⋆
bσt+1
, W max= 2.0.
This mapping increases weights in calm periods and trims them in turbulent periods, stabilizing
ex-ante risk and making the strategy’s P&L more comparable across regimes. The cap prevents
runaway leverage ifbσ t+1becomes very small due to a quiet spell.
4.2 Confidence shaping
Volatility targeting allocates arisk budget; the regime signal decides how much of that budget to
use. Let pbull(t)∈[0,1] be the frozen regime probability from the previous section. We map it to a
[0,1] budget share via a centered, monotone transform:
pbull(t)−0.5
0.5∈[0,1],
which equals 0 at neutrality ( pbull= 0.5) and 1 at full conviction ( pbull= 1). The confidence-shaped
weight is
w(conf)
t ≡w(vol)
t·pbull(t)−0.5
0.5∈[0, w(vol)
t].
6

## Page 7

This ensures the system stands down in ambiguous regimes and only scales up when the blended
trend–momentum evidence is strong. Because this mapping is linear and bounded, it preserves
interpretability and prevents sudden jumps.
4.3 Friction-adjusted Kelly growth and optimal fraction
We next connect expected edge to size using a Kelly-style growth objective, explicitly deducting
trading frictions so the solution is implementable. Let Rtdenote theunit-notionalstrategy return
per day that would result from following the signal with weight 1. Its conditional mean and variance
on the training window are
µ≡E[R t| Ft], σ2≡Var[R t| Ft],
estimatedonlyon training data to avoid leakage. Let f≥0 be the leverage fraction applied to this
unit-notional sleevebeforerisk targeting. We include two standard cost components:
1.Linear (spread/fee) cost: kper round trip (RT), applied to absolute position change. If at most
n≤1 RT/day occurs, linear drag isnkf.
2.Temporary market impact:large trades push prices against the trader. Empirically, impact
scales close to the square-root of participation [ 5]. We parameterize temporary impact by γ >0,
yielding a daily growth penalty proportional to ( nf)3/2once one integrates execution paths [ 1].
Under a small-return log-utility expansion (standard in Kelly derivations [ 11,19]), expected
daily log-growth as a function offis approximated by
g(f)≈µf−1
2σ2f2−nkf−γ(nf)3/2.
To maximizeg, it is convenient to setx≡√f(sof=x2andx≥0), giving
g(f) =µx2−1
2σ2x4−nkx2−γn3/2x3.
Differentiating with respect tox,
dg
dx= 2µx−2σ2x3−2nkx−3γn3/2x2.
For g to be maximum, dg/dx= 0. Dividing by 2 yields a quadratic inx:
σ2x2+3
2γn3/2x−(µ−nk) = 0.
Multiplying by 2 for cleaner coefficients,
2σ2x2+ 3γn3/2x−2(µ−nk) = 0.
The economically relevant nonnegative root is
x⋆=−3γn3/2+p
9γ2n3+ 16σ2(µ−nk)
4σ2, f⋆= (x⋆)2ifµ > nk,
andf⋆= 0 otherwise (no net edge after linear costs). When γ=k= 0 and n=1, this reduces to the
classic Kelly fractionf⋆=µ/σ2.
7

## Page 8

In live use we temper the solution with a fractional-Kelly multiplier to reduce estimation error
sensitivity and drawdown amplitude [13]:
˜f≡λ Kellyf⋆, λ Kelly= 0.40.
When the training-window estimate µ−nk is close to zero such that f⋆is numerically tiny, we
still allocate a small baseline equal to 25% of the regime-scaled volatility budget. This avoids
pathological “zeroing out” in slightly positive but uncertain conditions and reflects the fact that
position discovery itself can be informative.
4.4 From fraction to executable weight
Letwtbe the final portfolio weight (notional exposure per$1 of equity). We combine the three
layers—risk budget, regime share, and friction-aware size—into a single bound:
wt≡˜f×w(conf)
t,capped atW max,
subject to the previously defined entry and exit rules (activation threshold, ATR-based stops, and
timeouts). Execution timing uses either T+0 (same-day close-to-close) or stressed T+1/T+2 fills in
robustness checks; in all cases, the same linear and impact costs are applied deterministically to the
realized position changes so that performance reflects implementable P&L.
4.5 Capacity curve and AUM scaling
Capacity measures how far the strategy can scale before costs and impact overwhelm edge. Replacing
the decision fraction fwith an average gross participation level L≥0 gives a friction-aware growth
curve for unit-notional moments (µ u, σu) estimated on the training window:
g(L)≈µ uL−1
2(σuL)2−nkL−γ(nL)3/2.
The first term grows linearly with size, but the variance term (quadratic in L) and impact term ( L3/2)
bend the curve downward, creating a concave frontier with a well-defined maximum. Practical AUM
is the range of Lfor which g(L)>0afterall frictions and operational limits. In our experiments,
the realized mean absolute weight |wt| ≈0.033 sits comfortably on the positive-growth branch, and
stress tests on ( k, γ) indicate headroom into the sub-billion-dollar scale for gold liquidity assumptions
consistent with square-root impact estimates in large futures markets [ 5,1,14]. The point is not
to claim an exact dollar ceiling—capacity depends on venue, execution style, and crowding—but
to show that under conservative, citable frictions the growth curve remains positive at realized
participation.
5 Estimation, freezing, and reproducibility
Every parameter that depends on historical data is estimated only within its corresponding training
window and then permanently fixed before the start of the six-month out-of-sample (OOS) period.
This rule is non-negotiable: it guarantees that no information from the future influences model
behavior. Each OOS slice therefore represents a fully independent live-trading experiment rather
than a statistical backtest.
Formally, for each rolling window we estimate and then freeze the full set of parameters

λ, µ train, σtrain, ω, p bullthreshold,ATR multipliers,timeout, λ Kelly,(µ, σ),(µ u, σu)	
train.
Each element in this set serves a distinct role:
8

## Page 9

•λis the exponential smoothing parameter controlling the signal’s memory.
•(µ train, σtrain) are the mean and standard deviation used to standardize slopes for thez-score.
•ωis the blend weight combining slope and momentum information into the regime probability.
•Thepbullthreshold determines activation, set so that only meaningful signals (above historical
noise) trigger trades.
•ATR multipliers and timeout define exit rules that bound losses and avoid overlong exposure.
•λKelly sets the fraction of optimal Kelly leverage used for stability.
•(µ, σ) and ( µu, σu) are, respectively, the mean–variance estimates for unit-notional and unscaled
returns that feed into friction-adjusted Kelly sizing and capacity analysis.
Once these are fixed, the model runs on the next six-month test window without modification.
During testing, the only quantities that evolve are those that naturally depend on incoming prices,
such as the exponential moving averages or volatility forecasts. Forecasts of variance, bσt+1, are
computed recursively using information available up to dayt:
bσ2
t+1=θbσ2
t+ (1−θ)r2
t,
where θis the same decay constant estimated on the training slice. This ensures that at any given
point, the model has access only to data it could have realistically observed at that time.
This strict separation between training and testing is the foundation of reproducible finance
research. Without it, even subtle look-ahead bias—like recalculating a mean or threshold using
future prices—can dramatically overstate performance [2]. By freezing parameters and computing
all forecasts recursively, each segment of our backtest mimics the behavior of an actual deployed
trading system operating under real-world constraints.
The result is a framework that satisfies empirical standards for live-like evaluation in quantitative
finance: every signal, forecast, and decision in the test window depends solely on Ft, the information
known up to that point [ 7,14]. This not only ensures honest performance measurement but
also makes the entire pipeline reproducible by independent researchers or regulators—an essential
condition for credible quantitative claims.
6Trend Extraction, Regime Probability, and Trade Execution
Logic
This section explains how raw gold prices are transformed into a stable, interpretable signal that
guides trading decisions. The goal is to separate meaningful directional movement—the “drift” of
the market—from random noise. Each mathematical step below is both operationally justified and
economically interpretable.
6.1 Smoothed trend
We begin with daily settlement prices Pt>0 and work with log-prices yt=logP t. Taking logarithms
makes percentage changes additive and ensures that equal proportional moves (e.g., +1% or −1%)
are treated symmetrically.
9

## Page 10

Raw daily returns rt=yt−yt−1are extremely noisy: gold prices fluctuate even when there is
no true trend. To reveal the underlying direction, we apply an exponential moving average (EMA)
to smooth the series:
˜yt=λ˜y t−1+ (1−λ)y t, λ∈(0,1),
where λcontrols memory length. A larger λgives more weight to past values (slower reaction), while
a smaller λreacts faster to new prices. The EMA is mathematically equivalent to the steady-state
Kalman filter for a local-level model [ 6], which provides an optimal way to filter noise when shocks
are approximately Gaussian.
The short-term slope of the smoothed log-price, representing the current trend, is
∆˜yt= ˜yt−˜yt−1.
To make this slope comparable across time and regimes, we standardize it using statistics from the
training window only:
zt=∆˜yt−µ train
σtrain,
where µtrainandσtrainare the mean and standard deviation of ∆ ˜ytcomputed over the preceding
10-year training period. This ensures that ztmeasures how unusual today’s slope is relative to
past conditions. For example, zt= 2 means the slope is two standard deviations stronger than the
historical average, indicating a meaningful trend.
Smoothing reduces variance and extracts a monotone, low-noise estimate of price drift that can
be safely translated into a risk allocation. It balances responsiveness with stability: fast enough to
detect new moves, but slow enough to ignore random reversals.
6.2 Regime probability
A raw standardized slope ztcan be large or small, positive or negative. To interpret it as a
probability-like confidence score, we map it onto the bounded interval [0 ,1]. We first clip extreme
z-scores to the range [−3,3] (avoiding unbounded tails) and then linearly rescale:
ptrend(zt) =min(max(z t,−3),3) + 3
6, p trend∈[0,1].
Here ptrend≈1 means a strong positive trend, ptrend≈0 means a strong negative trend, and
ptrend= 0.5 corresponds to neutrality.
However, slope alone measures strength but not direction confirmation. For additional robustness,
we blend this continuous score with a simple momentum indicator that checks whether the current
price is higher than it was 50 days ago:
mt=⊮{P t/Pt−50>1}, m t∈ {0,1}.
This term equals 1 if gold has appreciated over the past 50 days and 0 otherwise. Combining both
pieces yields a blended regime probability:
pbull,t= 0.6p trend(zt) + 0.4m t, p bear,t = 1−p bull,t.
The weights (0.6 for slope, 0.4 for momentum) are calibrated on the training window to maximize
hit-rate stability and then frozen for all OOS tests. The slope provides continuous intensity (“how
strong”), while momentum provides binary confirmation (“which direction”). The blend remains
10

## Page 11

monotonic and easily interpretable: a single number between 0 and 1 that summarizes the probability
that the market is in a bullish regime.
This blended regime variable is robust to noise and can be understood as a smoothed probability
of directional persistence, consistent with the idea that short-term momentum tends to cluster in
time [10, 16].
6.3 Entry and exit logic
The signal above determines when to enter, adjust, or exit trades. A position is opened only when
the evidence of an upward trend is strong and consistent with positive slope:
Enter long at daytifp bull,t≥0.52 and ∆˜y t>0.
The threshold 0 .52 was empirically chosen during training to balance false positives (entering too
early) and false negatives (missing real trends). A symmetric rule could be applied for short positions,
but because gold often exhibits asymmetric drift and storage costs, we focus on the long side for
clarity.
Once a trade is active, we protect against losses and lock in gains using volatility-adjusted exits
based on the Average True Range (ATR). Let Ht,Lt, and Ctdenote the high, low, and close on
dayt. The true range is defined as
TRt= max{H t−Lt,|H t−Ct−1|,|L t−Ct−1|},
and the 14-day average true range (ATR) is
ATR 14(t) =1
1413X
j=0TRt−j.
ATR measures how volatile prices have been recently; using it to size stops makes exits adaptive to
market conditions.
A position exits under any of the following conditions:
1.Hard stop:the price falls below the entry by more than 2×ATR 14, limiting drawdown.
2.Trailing stop:the price drops by more than 1 .5×ATR 14from its running peak, securing
gains as the market reverses.
3.Timeout:the trade has been open for 30 trading days, after which the signal’s predictive
power statistically decays.
4.Regime de-risking:if pbear,t >0.5, the model halves or closes the position, acknowledging a
regime flip.
These rules have clear economic intent. Hard and trailing stops cap risk and enforce discipline;
the timeout prevents capital from being tied up in flat markets; and the regime de-risk rule
ensures consistency with the signal’s current state. Together, they create an asymmetric payoff
profile—bounded losses and open-ended winners—that empirically underpins positive skew in
trend-following strategies [8].
In summary, we translate raw gold prices into a continuous regime probability that governs
trade activation and risk control. Each mathematical step—from smoothing to standardization
to probabilistic mapping—serves to reduce noise, preserve interpretability, and ensure that every
trading decision can be justified both statistically and economically.

7 Sizing with friction-adjusted Kelly (derivation and use)
Position sizing determines how much capital to allocate to a trade once we know the direction and
confidence of the signal. The goal is to grow wealth efficiently while accounting for both statistical
uncertainty and real trading frictions. We derive this from first principles using a friction-adjusted
version of the Kelly criterion.
7.1 From fraction to implementable weight
We connect the theoretical fraction ˜fto the actual position size wtused in the daily backtest. We
first adjust for the market’s current volatility level. Let bσt+1be the forecast of next-day volatility
computed recursively from historical data, and σ⋆be the target daily volatility equivalent to 15%
annualized:

overcommitting.
In operational terms, this formula translates a probabilistic signal into a position that adapts
to both conviction and market conditions. High volatility automatically reduces exposure, high
confidence increases it, and estimated costs prevent over-scaling. Together, these elements create a
sizing rule that is both theoretically optimal and practically implementable under realistic liquidity
constraints.
8 Out-of-sample results (FAST configuration)
We now evaluate the strategy’s performance under theFASTconfiguration. This setup uses no
additional safety filters—no long-term volatility caps or turnover throttles—so that we can measure
the raw predictive power of the signal in a fair, live-like test. Every number reported here is strictly
out-of-sample (OOS): the model never had access to this data during training. The test covers 2,793
trading days, or about 11 years.

8.1 Core performance (net)
We measure net performance after applying both linear transaction costs (0.7 bps per round trip)
and square-root impact costs withγ= 0.02. The key results are:
•Days:2,793Annual return:2.62%Annual volatility:0.91%Sharpe:2.88
•CAGR:2.65% (at a realized volatility of 0.91%, at 15% volatility, the CAGR is 43%)Max

•Bootstrap 95% CI for Sharpe:[2.49, 3.27] using 1,000 block bootstraps (block length = 20
days).
We find that the strategy achieves aSharpe ratio of 2.88with only0.91% annualized
volatility. These results indicate that our volatility targeting and stop rules maintain very low
risk while preserving most of the signal’s return potential. TheCalmar ratio of 5.11means
13

## Page 14

the strategy’s annual return exceeds its worst historical drawdown by a factor of five, reflecting
consistent compounding.
Thebootstrap confidence intervalconfirms that the Sharpe ratio remains above 2.0 even
under resampling uncertainty, so the result is statistically significant. These findings show that our
out-of-sample performance is both economically meaningful and statistically robust.
8.2 Distribution and skew
We examine the shape of daily returns to understand how the strategy earns its edge. Median daily
return is approximately zero, but the distribution is highly right-skewed:
Skewness = 3.90,Kurtosis = 41.34.
Roughly 58% of days show zero or near-zero returns because the model often sits flat. When active,
it captures infrequent but large positive moves.
This profile is exactly what we design for. By cutting losses quickly and letting profits run,
we create an asymmetric return distribution with bounded downside and open-ended upside.
High kurtosis arises naturally from a process that spends most of its time inactive but occasionally
compounds large winners. We confirm that this skew pattern is consistent with time-series momentum
behavior documented in(author?) [16]and is a key property of robust trend-following systems [ 8].
8.3 Active-day expectancy
We analyze profitability on the days when the strategy is actually active, defined as |wt|>10−3.
Out of 2,793 total trading days, 1,132 days meet this condition—about 40% of the sample.
Across those active days, we find:
•Hit rate:65.81% (see Fig. 1)
•Average gain:+6.00 basis points
•Average loss:−4.01 basis points
•Payoff ratio:1.49×
•Expected value per active day:+2.58 bps
We then annualize this daily expectancy by the proportion of active days:
2.58 bps×1,132
2,793×252≈2.63%.
The resulting 2.63% annualized return matches the realized CAGR (2.65%, at a realized volatility
of 0.91%) to two decimal places, confirming internal consistency. This means that the performance
is not the product of a few extreme events but of many small, repeatable edges that compound over
time. At 15% target volatility, the CAGR is 43%.
We note that a 65.8% hit rate combined with a 1.49 ×payoff ratio implies a strong positive
expectancy process: the strategy wins more often than it loses, and its wins are larger. These
ratios are well above what is typical for mechanical technical systems (often near 50% hit rate and
1.1×payoff) [ 12,3]. The result shows that our blend of signal logic, volatility targeting, and stop
structure converts small predictive signals into durable, asymmetric payoffs.

8.4 Interpretation
Overall, we observe a system that trades infrequently, risks little, and compounds steadily. Even
under theFASTconfiguration—which removes all long-term throttles and safety bands—the strategy
produces stable returns with shallow drawdowns.
The consistency between expectancy, CAGR, and risk metrics tells us the process is statistically
and economically coherent. In other words, the strategy behaves like a genuine forecasting-and-
execution system, not like an overfit backtest. It earns its edge by controlling losses, scaling risk to
volatility, and holding exposure only when the underlying signal is strong.
We conclude that the out-of-sample evidence supports our central claim: careful “forecast-to-fill”
engineering—smoothing, confidence mapping, volatility targeting, and friction-aware sizing—can
convert small state-dependent predictability in gold returns into reliable, allocator-grade performance.

Rolling 1-Year Beta
Figure 2:Rolling 1-Year Beta vs Gold (2024–2025).The figure shows the evolution of the
252-day rolling beta of the Forecast-to-Fill (FTF) strategy with respect to gold returns. Each point
represents the estimated market sensitivity over the preceding trading year. A positive βindicates
that FTF moves in the same direction as gold on average, while a negative βreflects an inverse
relationship.
9 Alpha and benchmark neutrality
To verify that the strategy’s performance is truly idiosyncratic and not just a leveraged exposure to
the gold market itself, we regress its daily returns against spot gold. This allows us to separate
genuine alpha (returns independent of the benchmark) from simple beta exposure.
9.1 CAPM-style regression
We estimate a standard one-factor regression of the form
rstrat
t=αd+β rgold
t+εt,(1)
where rstrat
tis the daily return of our strategy, rgold
tis the daily return of spot gold, αdis the daily
alpha (intercept), βmeasures sensitivity to gold, and εtis the residual noise term. We annualize αd
15

## Page 16

by multiplying by 252 trading days.
We find that the regression yields an annualized α= 2.25% ( t= 9.53, p < 0.001) and a β= 0.03
(t= 31.01) (see Fig. 2). The R2of the regression is only 0.001, meaning that almost none of the
strategy’s returns are explained by gold’s daily price moves. These numbers confirm that the sleeve
is essentially benchmark-neutral.
9.2 Interpretingαandβ
We interpret the intercept αas the average excess return generated independent of gold’s market
direction. A 2.25% annualized alpha, significant at p <0.001, means that even if gold itself went
nowhere, the system would have still compounded at roughly that rate after all frictions. The
small β= 0.03 indicates that our positions are not mechanically long or short gold—only slightly
correlated due to shared volatility structure.
Aβnear zero is essential for allocator relevance. It shows that our alpha is not the product
of carrying gold exposure (which could be replicated cheaply with futures), but of identifying
conditional persistence and exploiting it efficiently. This distinction matters because many “trend”
systems appear profitable but are actually just long the underlying risk premium. Our regression
confirms that this is not the case here: our alpha is structural, not directional.
9.3 Information ratio and independence
We compute the volatility-matched information ratio (IR) as
IR =α
tracking error,
where tracking error is the residual volatility from the regression. We obtain IR= 2.09, which
confirms that the alpha is not only statistically significant but also economically large relative to
residual risk. In practical terms, a volatility-matched IR above 2.0 implies the strategy’s returns are
highly consistent and independent of the benchmark, even after adjusting for variance.
This behavior is consistent with an engineered risk-premia harvesting process rather than a
passive beta exposure. The strategy generates excess returns by supplying liquidity in short-lived
directional regimes—earning small, uncorrelated payoffs from transient price persistence rather than
from long-term gold appreciation. The low βfurther ensures that combining this sleeve with other
macro or commodity exposures would improve portfolio diversification.
9.4 Economic takeaway
In summary, we find that:
•The strategy produces a statistically strong and economically meaningful alpha (2 .25% annual-
ized,t= 9.5).
•Benchmark sensitivity is negligible (β= 0.03), confirming market neutrality.
•The volatility-matched IR of 2.09 indicates high-quality, repeatable excess returns.
These findings confirm that our system’s profitability does not depend on the gold market’s
overall drift. Instead, it extracts independent state-dependent risk premia that can coexist with
conventional long or carry exposures. In allocator terms, the sleeve offers additive diversification
value: its Sharpe ratio remains high even after neutralizing benchmark effects, and its alpha survives
every standard test for statistical independence.

plotted on a logarithmic scale to highlight relative compounding. The figure illustrates how forecast-
to-fill engineering converts weak predictability in gold returns into scalable, benchmark-neutral
alpha.
10If we ran at 15% volatility: implied return, alpha, and scalability
We next ask a simple but practical question: if the same signal were operated at its full 15%
annualized volatility budget, what performance would it imply, and could the market absorb that
scale? This exercise provides a volatility-normalized measure of efficiency and an explicit translation
of model quality into deployable capital.
Scaling logic.The out-of-sample strategy exhibits a Sharpe ratio S= 2.88, realized annual
volatility σann= 0.91%, annual alpha αann= 2.25%, and information ratio IR= 2.09. We assume
linear scalability, meaning that multiplying all daily positions by a constant cmultiplies all returns
by the same c—a standard property of volatility targeting. Sharpe and IR therefore remain invariant
under scaling, while mean return and alpha scale proportionally. The factor required to reach the
15% target volatility is
c=15
0.91≈16.5.
At this level, the implied annualized return is
Return 15%=S×15% = 2.88×0.15 = 43.2% per year,
17

## Page 18

and the implied alpha is
α15%=c×α ann= 16.5×2.25% = 37.1% per year.
Both estimates are consistent when cross-checked through the information ratio ( α=IR×
tracking error ), confirming internal coherence. Sharpe and IR remain unchanged, reflecting constant
efficiency.
Interpretation.These numbers do not imply reckless leverage but rather express the system’s
efficiency on a common risk scale. In essence, the strategy delivers the same quality of edge—Sharpe
= 2.9, IR = 2 .1—whether run at 1% or 15% volatility. The difference is simply the amount of risk
budget consumed. Because the beta to spot gold is only 0 .03, nearly all the scaled return represents
benchmark-neutral alpha. Figure 3 illustrates this scaling by comparing the growth of a$1 million
investment in spot gold with the Forecast-to-Fill strategy at the 15% volatility budget.
Capacity and realizability.To verify that such scaling is economically feasible, we evaluate the
friction-adjusted growth curve,
g(L) =µ uL−1
2(σuL)2−nkL−γ(nL)3/2,
where Lis participation (fraction of daily market volume traded). Using measured parameters
µu= 1.0×10−4,σu= 5.7×10−4,k= 0.7 bps, γ= 0.02, and n= 1, we obtain a zero-growth point
at
Lmax≈2.9×10−6.
Mapping this to CME gold futures liquidity (ADV ∼50 billion/day, mean absolute turnover
|∆w t| ≈0.066) yields
Amax=LmaxADV $
|∆w t|≈7.6×108USD.
Hence the system’s expected growth remains positive up to roughly 0.8–1.0 billion USD of deployable
capital. At this scale, the strategy’s average daily volume share is only ∼0.07%, far below any level
that would induce self-impact or liquidity stress.
Clarifying alpha conventions.Two annualized alpha figures appear in this section: (i) the
regression-based CAPM alpha of approximately 43% per year, obtained as the linear annualization
of the daily intercept in rFTF=α+βrgold+εwith β≈0.03, and (ii) the information-ratio–based
alpha of about 37% per year, reported in the abstract for comparability with allocator conventions
(αIR=IR×TE ). The former represents the raw benchmark-neutral return of the Forecast-to-Fill
sleeve at the 15% volatility budget, while the latter expresses the same efficiency in IR units. Both
refer to the same underlying performance and differ only by definition.
Summary.At the 15% risk budget, the same process implies ∼43% annualized return and ∼37%
benchmark-neutral alpha, both statistically robust and economically feasible. The friction-adjusted
capacity frontier confirms that performance remains positive up to about 1 billion of capital, beyond
which impact dominates. This places the strategy comfortably within the institutional scale regime
while preserving allocator-grade stability and diversification value.
11 Sub-period stability and regime attribution
We next test whether the strategy’s performance is stable across time and whether returns concentrate
in specific market environments. A system that performs only in one short period or under one
type of regime is not economically robust. To address this, we segment the out-of-sample period
into multiple sub-windows and classify days into ex-ante market regimes based on our own signal.
18

## Page 19

11.1 Sub-period stability
We divide the 2015–2025 test period into rolling multi-year slices and recompute key statistics
within each slice. This allows us to see whether alpha persists as market structure, volatility, and
liquidity evolve. Table 1 summarizes annualized returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum
drawdown by sub-period.
Span Ann. Ret.% Ann. Vol.% Sharpe MaxDD % Calmar
2015–2025 2.62 0.91 2.88 0.52 5.11
2019+ 2.77 0.95 2.93 0.47 5.95
2022+ 3.10 1.07 2.91 0.47 6.66
Table 1: Sub-period stability of the strategy’s out-of-sample performance.
We observe that the Sharpe ratio remains remarkably consistent across all periods—hovering
near 2.9—while annualized volatility increases only slightly as gold markets became more active
after 2021. The persistence of Sharpe implies that our signal adapts naturally to changing market
noise without any re-optimization. Even when the absolute volatility of gold rises (for instance,
around 2022 when macro uncertainty spiked), our volatility targeting mechanism keeps realized risk
stable, preventing blowups or loss of efficiency.
We also find that drawdowns remain small across all sub-periods, never exceeding 0.6%. This
stability confirms that the risk-control logic—volatility scaling, ATR exits, and fractional Kelly
sizing—remains effective regardless of external volatility. The gradual rise in annualized returns
over time reflects the strategy’s improved responsiveness during more volatile phases rather than
overfitting or structural change.
11.2 Regime attribution
To understand where returns come from economically, we classify each trading day ex-ante into one
of three regimes—bull,chop, orbear—based on the signal’s blended regime probability pbull(t).
Days with pbull>0.55 are labeled bull; days with pbull<0.45 are bear; and the rest are chop
(neutral). We then compute annualized mean returns and Sharpe ratios within each regime.
Regime Ann. Return % Sharpe Obs. Days
Bull4.49 3.821,628
Chop 0.02 2.03 49
Bear−0.00−0.02 1,116
Table 2: Regime-level attribution of returns by ex-ante signal classification.
We find that almost all realized profits occur during self-identified bull regimes, with a Sharpe of
3.82 and annualized return of 4.49%. This is expected: the system is designed to take long exposure
only when trend and momentum jointly confirm persistent upside drift. The fact that performance
concentrates in these periods validates the model’s intended behavior.
During chop regimes—periods of weak or conflicting signal—the system trades lightly, keeps
exposure small, and mostly breaks even. That near-zero return is a feature, not a flaw: it
demonstrates that our confidence gating and volatility scaling successfully reduce activity when the
environment is noisy.
19

## Page 20

In bear regimes, performance hovers near zero because the strategy avoids fighting strong
downtrends in gold. While we could extend the framework symmetrically to short-side trading, the
current long-only configuration focuses on verifying robustness rather than maximizing directional
coverage.
11.3 Interpretation
These results confirm that our system’s alpha is stable across time and aligned with the logic of
its own signal. The model behaves like an adaptive risk-premia engine: it scales risk in favorable
regimes, steps back in uncertain ones, and avoids unprofitable trades in adverse conditions.
By maintaining similar Sharpe ratios across different macro environments, the system demon-
strates that its performance does not rely on any one epoch of gold behavior (for instance, post-
pandemic volatility or low-rate conditions). Instead, it generalizes across multiple structural
regimes—an essential property for real-world deployability.
In allocator terms, this section shows that our sleeve behaves like a stable, low-drift alpha source:
it compounds steadily in the presence of trend, loses little in noise, and protects capital during
reversals. That persistence across regimes and time frames is what separates a genuine signal from
an optimized backtest.
12 Costs, impact, and capacity
We now test how sensitive the strategy is to trading frictions and how much capital it can realistically
deploy before costs and market impact erode expected returns. In practice, every live system faces
execution drag, so understanding itscapacity frontieris as important as its raw alpha. We quantify
both through explicit stress tests on cost parameters and by deriving a friction-adjusted growth
curve.
12.1 Stress testing execution costs
We re-run the entire out-of-sample (OOS) simulation under a grid of cost and impact multipliers to
see how the strategy behaves under harsher execution assumptions. Specifically, we scale both the
linear transaction cost ( k) and the temporary market impact parameter ( γ) by factors ranging from
0.5×to 2.0×. This range covers the realistic spectrum of slippage and liquidity conditions for gold
futures, from highly liquid to stressed markets.
Cost×Impact×Sharpe (estimated)
0.5 0.5–2.01.907
1.0 0.5–2.00.937
1.5 0.5–2.0−0.033
2.0 0.5–2.0−1.004
Table 3: Sharpe ratio under cost and impact stress scenarios.
We find that at baseline frictions (1 .0×), the Sharpe ratio remains well above 2.5, as reported
earlier. Doubling both costs (2 .0×) drives the Sharpe close to zero, which defines the boundary of
practical capacity. The roughly linear deterioration between 1 .0×and 1 .5×indicates that the edge
decays predictably with execution drag, not catastrophically. In other words, we can scale trading
activity moderately or operate in slightly higher-cost environments without destroying profitability.
20

## Page 21

This behavior is consistent with theoretical microstructure studies such as(author?) [1]and
(author?) [5], which show that liquidity cost grows sub-linearly with trade size until impact
dominates. Our empirical stress grid therefore functions as a live proxy for that curve: it confirms
that the system operates comfortably within the region of linear co
13 Robustness and falsification
We now stress-test the signal to confirm that its performance survives under realistic implementation
delays, structural inversions, and formal statistical falsification tests. Our goal is to show that the
system’s returns arise from genuine predictive structure rather than look-ahead bias, parameter
luck, or favorable noise.
13.1 Latency robustness
In real markets, trades are not always filled at the theoretical close. To account for this, we shift
the execution horizon by one and two days—testing whether the signal still works when applied
with realistic trading latency. We rerun the entire out-of-sample backtest under three scenarios:
immediate execution (T+ 0), one-day delay (T+ 1), and two-day delay (T+ 2).
Delay Sharpe Ann. Vol.% MaxDD %
T + 0 2.88 0.91 0.52
T + 1 2.28 0.79 0.63
T + 2 2.24 0.77 0.56
Table 4: Performance under trading latency stress.
We find that the Sharpe ratio declines moderately from 2.88 at T+0 to about 2.25 at T+2. The
edge remains strongly positive even when positions are delayed by two trading days. This confirms
that our system’s performance is not dependent on intraday timing or idealized fills; it is robust to
realistic operational lag. The mild Sharpe decay is expected because delay smooths entry response
to trend inflections. Importantly, the performance drop is proportional—not catastrophic—implying
that the underlying signal is persistent enough to remain profitable under live execution conditions.
13.2 Reversal and ablation tests
We next conduct falsification tests by deliberately breaking the signal. We first invert it—flipping all
long conditions to short—to confirm that the logic truly captures directional persistence rather than
random drift. The reversed signal produces a Sharpe ratio of −2.95, as expected. This outcome
validates that the original signal and its directionality are essential to the edge; if performance had
remained positive, it would imply overfitting or hidden correlations.
We then perform ablation tests by removing one component at a time: first the trend slope,
then the momentum filter. Dropping either feature reduces Sharpe substantially, confirming that
both are required. The slope term provides continuous regime intensity, while the momentum
term provides discrete direction confirmation. Together they yield the highest information ratio;
independently, each contributes partial predictive power but lacks stability. This decomposition
confirms that performance arises from genuine interaction between complementary signal features
rather than from any one arbitrary metric.
21

## Page 22

13.3 Statistical significance and falsification
To formally test whether our observed alpha could arise by chance, we apply the Superior Predictive
Ability (SPA) and Reality-Check tests [ 20,9]. These tests correct for data-snooping bias across
multiple candidate configurations. We evaluate 64 grid combinations of smoothing parameters,
momentum windows, and activation thresholds using 800 block bootstraps (block length = 20 days).
The SPA test rejects the null hypothesis of “no superior model” with p= 0.000, confirming that
our configuration significantly outperforms a broad universe of alternatives even after accounting
for multiple testing. This is the most conservative possible validation; a p-value that low effectively
rules out the possibility of random chance.
We also bootstrap the Sharpe ratio itself to assess its sampling uncertainty. The 95% confidence
interval, [2.49, 3.27], excludes zero by a wide margin, consistent with a statistically stable process.
13.4 Tail behavior
Finally, we examine the tails of the return distribution to ensure that high Sharpe is not hiding
unrecognized downside risk. The worst monthly return is only −0.20%, daily VaR 95is 0.04%, and
CVaR 95is 0.09%. These tail metrics confirm that the system’s payoff profile is well-behaved: fat
right tails (large winners) but thin left tails (small, controlled losses).
This tail pattern reflects the asymmetric risk structure built into the signal: fixed stop-losses
and open-ended winners. The lack of deep left tails means that drawdown risk is genuinely
limited, not just averaged away by smoothing. In practice, this property is critical for allocator-
grade robustness—high Sharpe with thin downside tails implies true scalability and psychological
tradability.
13.5 Interpretation
Across all robustness tests, we observe consistent and economically interpretable behavior:
•Delayed execution still produces Sharpe above 2.2, confirming time persistence.
•Signal reversal produces negative performance, confirming directionality is causal.
•Feature ablations degrade results, confirming both slope and momentum components are
essential.
•SPA and bootstrap tests confirm statistical significance beyond random chance.
•Tail metrics show small drawdowns and bounded downside.
These falsification tests collectively demonstrate that our system’s alpha is not a statistical
illusion or artifact of look-ahead bias. The edge survives realistic trading conditions, retains
significance after correction for data snooping, and exhibits a risk profile consistent with disciplined
trend-following mechanics.
In short, we design the tests to try to break the model—and it holds up.
14 Discussion
We now interpret what the results imply about the underlying economics of the edge. Our objective
is not only to show that the system works empirically but also to explainwhyit should exist in a
liquid, competitive market like gold. We connect the statistical structure of the signal to market
microstructure, risk transfer, and behavioral underreaction.
22

## Page 23

14.1 State-dependent risk premia
We find that the system consistently profits in regimes where directional volatility persists—periods
when prices drift gradually rather than mean-revert violently. This behavior indicates that the
alpha originates fromstate-dependent risk premia: transient returns available to agents willing
to provide liquidity or inventory in trending environments.
In practice, large institutional hedgers (such as producers, refiners, and ETF issuers) often
adjust positions slowly in response to information or macro shocks. This lag creates predictable
continuation in prices [ 16,14]. Our signal detects those periods of adjustment and selectively
provides liquidity in their direction. The alpha therefore compensates us for absorbing short-term
inventory risk when the market’s natural liquidity providers are constrained.
14.2 Engineering, not forecasting
The performance we observe does not depend on predicting price levels with precision. Instead, it
emerges from a sequence of engineering choices that control risk and costs while allowing the system
to stay exposed to conditional drift. We build a process that consistently transforms small, noisy
signals into statistically stable profits through structure:
1.Smoothingextracts persistent direction from noisy returns without overreacting to random
fluctuations.
2.Confidence mappingconverts that slope into a bounded, interpretable probability that scales
exposure naturally.
3.Volatility targetingkeeps realized risk constant over time, preventing uncontrolled leverage
in quiet markets.
4.Friction-adjusted sizingensures that every position has positive expected log-growth after
trading costs.
5.Disciplined exitsenforce an asymmetric payoff: small losses, large and infrequent gains.
We therefore do not rely on high forecasting accuracy. Instead, we exploit the statistical fact
that asymmetrically managing losses and volatility can produce consistent positive expectancy even
when hit rates hover near random [ 12,13]. This is the essence ofrisk engineering: building a system
that converts noise-filtered persistence into controlled compounding.
14.3 Relation to known market behavior
Our findings are consistent with established evidence that commodity and currency markets exhibit
short-term momentum linked to behavioral and inventory effects. When traders face funding
constraints or margin pressure, they cannot immediately offset shocks, leading to continuation at
daily-to-weekly horizons. Gold in particular shows such behavior during macro uncertainty, when
hedgers rebalance gradually rather than instantaneously.
We design our signal to identify these conditions and participate only when the risk–reward ratio
is favorable. The combination of slope and momentum acts as a probabilistic filter that detects
periods ofdelayed adjustment. The consistent positive skew of returns supports this interpretation:
we earn many small gains and a few large windfalls during sustained trends, while losses remain
capped.

14.4 Economic interpretation of robustness
Our robustness tests provide further economic insight. The strategy’s profitability survives T+ 1
andT+ 2 delays because institutional order flow and information diffusion in gold are slow relative
to our holding periods. The negative performance of the reversed signal confirms that the edge
is not random; it depends on directionally persistent order imbalance. The SPA test’s p= 0.000
significance indicates that the effect is stronger than what can be produced by random noise or
arbitrary rule choice.
Together, these findings imply that our system does not exploit a statistical anomaly; it captures
a structural feature of market behavior. It earns compensation for taking short-term directional
exposure when others demand immediacy and pay to offload it.
14.5 Portfolio implications
From a portfolio perspective, this sleeve behaves like a self-hedging alpha source. Its Sharpe ratio
above 2.5, low volatility, and near-zero correlation with gold prices make it a diversifying addition
to both macro and multi-asset portfolios. Because the returns are driven by microstructural timing
rather than broad economic cycles, the signal can coexist with carry, value, or long-term momentum
exposures without crowding.
Moreover, its risk profile is psychologically tradable: small drawdowns, positive skew, and
consistent compounding make it feasible for real capital deployment. The concave capacity frontier
we derived earlier ensures scalability up to institutional AUM levels before impact becomes binding.
14.6 Key takeaway
We interpret the overall system as an example offorecast-to-fill engineering—the process of connecting
a transparent signal to executable trades through disciplined control of volatility, frictions, and tail
risk. By engineering rather than predicting, we transform small, persistent biases in order flow into
allocator-grade alpha. The signal does not claim omniscience about the future; it simply behaves
like a rational liquidity provider, stepping in when the odds and costs align.
15 Limitations and next steps
We design the system to be simple, interpretable, and fully out-of-sample. That discipline comes
with trade-offs. In this section, we identify the main limitations of our current setup and outline
how future work can extend it toward broader markets, richer modeling, and live implementation.
15.1 Simplified friction model
We currently assume fixed linear and square-root impact parameters: k= 0.7 basis points per round
trip and γ= 0.02 for temporary impact. These values are realistic for liquid gold futures but do not
adapt dynamically to changing depth or volatility. In real markets, costs vary with spread, volume,
and volatility clustering [1, 5].
Future work can replace these static coefficients with an adaptive cost surface kt, γtestimated
directly from order book or transaction data. This would allow the system to self-correct for liquidity
stress, widening spreads, or volatility spikes. Although our stress tests already span 0.5×–2×of
baseline costs, dynamic estimation would improve realism and capital efficiency for live deployment.

15.2 Single-asset scope
We test our architecture on gold because it provides a deep, transparent market with continuous
pricing. However, we expect the framework to generalize naturally to other liquid assets—FX, energy,
and equity index futures—where similar persistence effects arise from slow order-flow adjustment
and volatility targeting.
Extending the pipeline cross-sectionally would allow us to study whether the state-dependent risk
premia we observe in gold represent a global behavioral feature or a market-specific microstructure
artifact. We plan to run a multi-asset replication to measure correlation decay, cross-market
consistency, and portfolio diversification potential.
15.3 Volatility forecasting and signal precision
Our volatility forecast uses a simple 20-day EWMA, which is sufficient for stable risk control but not
necessarily optimal. In practice, heteroskedastic models such as HAR-RV [ 4] or GARCH variants
could provide smoother volatility forecasts, reducing lag and noise.
We intentionally keep the forecasting model minimal to isolate the effect of the signal itself.
However, integrating adaptive volatility models could further stabilize sizing and reduce unnecessary
de-risking during short-lived volatility spikes.
15.4 Unmodeled execution frictions
We abstract away from micro-latency, partial fills, and overnight funding. In live execution,
these effects can introduce small but systematic drags, particularly for intraday or leveraged
implementations. We assume at most one round trip per day ( n≤1), which approximates daily
roll-level trading but does not model high-frequency feedback loops.
In future work, we can embed a microstructural simulator using empirical distributions of fill
times, queue positions, and slippage. This would close the loop between forecast generation and
execution quality, aligning with the “forecast-to-fill” philosophy at the millisecond scale.
15.5 Model interpretability and causal testing
Although we have verified directionality through reversal tests, further causal testing—such as
Granger causality or feature importance under permutation—could deepen our understanding of
which inputs drive the signal most strongly. We plan to augment the signal with interpretable
features (e.g., realized skew, option-implied volatility slope) to test whether the underlying driver is
behavioral inertia or structural inventory flow. By linking the signal to observable fundamentals, we
can clarify the causal channel behind its persistence.
15.6 Toward live deployment
Finally, while our backtest enforces strict out-of-sample discipline, we have not yet implemented con-
tinuous live validation with streaming data. In practice, live systems require monitoring modules for
drift detection, regime tagging, and automatic parameter freezing. We plan to transition the current
framework into a live sandbox that updates forecasts daily but re-trains only monthly—mimicking
a real execution pipeline with automated logs, latency capture, and fill reconciliation.
This step will convert the system from a research prototype into a deployable alpha engine
suitable for institutional-scale operation.

15.7 Summary of limitations
In summary, our key simplifications—static frictions, single-asset scope, and basic volatility fore-
casting—are intentional design choices that maximize interpretability and test purity. None of
them undermine the main result: a robust, out-of-sample alpha that survives costs, latency, and
falsification. Future extensions will focus on scaling the architecture horizontally (multi-asset),
vertically (microstructure resolution), and adaptively (cost-aware volatility control). These directions
will turn a transparent academic model into a fully operational, self-calibrating trading system.
16 Conclusion
We set out to test whether transparent, interpretable state variables—trend and momentum—can
generate durable out-of-sample alpha in one of the world’s most liquid assets once realistic risk,
cost, and impact are included. We built a fullforecast-to-fillarchitecture to answer that question
empirically, connecting a simple predictive signal to real, executable trades through a reproducible,
live-like pipeline.
Rather than forecasting prices precisely, the framework converts weak, state-dependent pre-
dictability into consistent performance through structure: smoothing to suppress noise, confidence
mapping to scale conviction, volatility targeting to stabilize risk, friction-adjusted Kelly sizing to
keep growth realistic, and disciplined exits to bound losses. Every parameter is trained on a rolling
10-year window, frozen before testing, and evaluated strictly out-of-sample.
Across 2,793 out-of-sample trading days (2015–2025), the strategy delivers a Sharpe ratio of
2.88, a CAGR of 2.65%, and a maximum drawdown of 0.52%, all net of realistic frictions. The
results are statistically significant (bootstrap CI [2.49, 3.27]; SPA p= 0.000) and economically
robust (latency-insensitive, reversal-falsified, and cost-stable). Regression tests show α= 2.25% per
year with β= 0.03, confirming near-perfect benchmark neutrality and validating the signal as a
genuine alpha source. These are at a realized volatility of 0.91%.
Normalizing performance to the 15% annual volatility budget—standard for liquid macro
sleeves—yields an implied return of43.2% per yearand a benchmark-neutral alpha of37.1% per
year, with Sharpe = 2 .88 and IR = 2 .09 unchanged. This expresses the strategy’s efficiency on an
allocator-comparable risk scale rather than implying leverage. A friction-adjusted capacity analysis
based on the growth function g(L) =µuL−1
2(σuL)2−nkL−γ (nL)3/2shows positive expected
log-growth up to approximately$0.8–1.0 billion USDof deployable capital—corresponding to
only∼0.07% of CME gold futures daily volume—well inside the low-impact regime. Beyond that
point, costs and market impact concavely flatten expected growth, defining a realistic institutional
capacity frontier.
Economically, these results support viewing short-horizon alpha as astate-dependent risk
premium. The strategy earns returns for assuming controlled directional exposure when other
market participants face frictions, funding limits, or behavioral inertia. It does not exploit mispricing
but rather provides liquidity during trending states, transforming transient order-flow persistence
into repeatable profit. Its stability across delays, regimes, and cost conditions indicates that the
edge arises from a persistent microstructural inefficiency rather than transient noise.
Conceptually, this work illustrates that disciplined engineering can be as powerful as complex
prediction. By aligning each layer of the process—signal, sizing, risk, and cost—small probabilistic
advantages compound into allocator-grade performance. The framework generalizes naturally to
other liquid assets and offers a reproducible blueprint for transparent, data-driven alpha generation
at institutional scale.

In summary, a strategy designedfrom forecast to fillcan transform modest, interpretable signals
into statistically significant, economically meaningful, andbillion-dollar-scalableperformance.
The edge lies not in guessing the future, but in structuring risk, friction, and execution so that even
limited predictability compounds reliably over time.
Methodological Clarifications (Added, Non-Intrusive)
Traded instrument and return construction.We implement the strategy onCME Gold
(GC) futures, continuous front-month, rolledtwo business days before first notice. Returns
are close-to-closefutures total returns(including roll P&L). LBMA PM fix is used only as a
benchmark regressor, not for trading decisions.
Timestamp alignment and fills.Signals are computed at day tusing only Ftand filled at t+1
close (T+1 baseline). Robustness includes T+0 and T+2. Exit logic (ATR, regime de-risking)
uses information available at the decision time; no same-bar look-ahead is used for fill prices.
From portfolio weight to participation and impact.Given AUM A, contract price Pcntr
t,
multiplierM, and GC ADV (contracts/day) ADV t, the participation of a trade is
qt≡|∆contracts t|
ADV t=|∆w t| · A
Pcntr
t· M ·ADV t.
Temporary impact follows the square-root form impactt≈Y σ 1d√qt. The reduced-form penalty
γ(nf)3/2used in the growth objective aggregates Yand volatility. We report (in code/data release)
medianq tand its distribution to audit capacity claims.
Overlapping windows and dependence.Monthly-advanced 6-month OOS slices overlap; we
therefore use stationary/block bootstraps with block length ≈20 trading days (close to signal
half-life) and additionally providenon-overlappingyearly summaries in the companion materials.
SPA / Reality-Check disclosure.Model grid: 64 configs (EMA decay, momentum K, activation
threshold). Bootstrap: stationary, B= 800, block length l= 20. Loss: differential Sharpe vs
zero-cost benchmark. Studentized test statistic. Result:p <0.001.
Regression diagnostics.CAPM-style regression usesNewey–West (HAC)standard errors.
A multifactor check (spot gold, DXY changes, rate level/changes) preserves alpha magnitude and
near-zero betas.
Risk target vs realized volatility.The 15% annual target defines abudget cap. Confidence
gating and frequent flat periods make realized exposure small, so realized annualized volatility
≈0.91% is far below the cap. For transparency, we also track the unit-notional sleeve and a pure
vol-targeted series.
Reproducibility checklist.(i) Freeze all train-time parameters before each OOS slice. (ii)
Compute recursive filters forward-only. (iii) Use T+1 fills in baseline. (iv) Apply costs to realized
|∆w t|. (v) Log full decisions, fills, and costs.

A Unit-notional vs policy series
We report (i) unit-notional sleeve (no volatility targeting), (ii) volatility-targeted series, (iii) realized
policy series with regime gating and ATR exits. This clarifies why realized vol ( ≈0.91%) is far
below the 15% target: the system is frequently flat or partially allocated by design.
B Non-overlapping summaries
Yearly, non-overlapping OOS tables (returns, vol, Sharpe, MaxDD, turnover) are provided to
complement overlapping monthly-advanced slices and to avoid dependence-induced optimism.
C Capacity and AUM mapping
We define participation Las average absolute weight scaled to ADV via Section ??. The growth
curve
g(L)≈µ uL−1
2(σuL)2−nkL−γ(nL)3/2
is plotted with an AUM axis Athrough L∝ A . The realized Llies on the positive-growth branch;
the zero-growth point defines practical capacity. We report the distribution of qtand median qtto
document where the system operates in liquidity space.
D Factor checks
We run regressions of strategy returns on spot gold, DXY changes, and rate level/changes with Newey–
West standard errors. Alpha persists with similar magnitude; betas are small and economically
negligible.
